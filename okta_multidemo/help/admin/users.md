## Users admin

This page uses the [Okta Resources API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/), [Users endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/) to get a list of users in the Okta org.

Access is granted using [OAuth for Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/overview/), which enables access to Okta's [Resources API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/) using scoped, expiring OAuth 2.0 access tokens instead of static long lived API key.

The user who accesses this page must have an [Administrator role](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/Administrators.htm) with appropriate access to the requested scope(s).
