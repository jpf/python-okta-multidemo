## Users admin

This page uses the [Okta Resources API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/), [Users endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/) to get a list of users in the Okta org.

It currently uses the global API key for this purpose; ideally we would use use scoped OAuth 2.0 access tokens.  See: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/overview/
