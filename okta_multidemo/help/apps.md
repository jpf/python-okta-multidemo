## Apps

This page uses the [Okta Resources API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/) [Apps endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/apps/) to get a list of apps for the currently logged in user for purposes of SSO into those apps.

It currently uses the global API key for this purpose; ideally we would use use scoped OAuth 2.0 access tokens.  See: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/overview/
